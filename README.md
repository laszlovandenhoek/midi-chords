# midi-chords

Tells you what chord you are playing via WebMIDI.

This version, by [László van den Hoek](https://github.com/laszlovandenhoek), is a fork of the original version at [fheyen.github.io/midi-chords](https://fheyen.github.io/midi-chords/), which is powered by [musicvis-lib](https://github.com/fheyen/musicvis-lib).

It adds the following features:
- A challenge mode, where you have to play a sequence of notes or chords.
- Registering and tracking your performance, such as accuracy and speed.

Works only in browsers that support this API, for example Chrome and Opera.
